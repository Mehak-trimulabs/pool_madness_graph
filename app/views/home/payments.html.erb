    <h1>Types of Payment</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
    Each bracket entry in the pool has a $10 entry fee. Ways to pay online are limited for the pool because payments
    for basketball pools are against the Terms of Service of most credit cards and processors. The four options are
    described in detail below.
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of these methods assume trust that the proverbial "check is in the mail". We're all friends here. Filling out
    a bracket assumes you've agreed to pay the entry fee before the tournament starts. In some circumstances that's not
    possible. Therefore, <strong>if you need extra time you must make arrangements with a pool administrator</strong>.
    Failure to make good on the arrangement will result in removal of the bracket from the pool and potential ban from
    future pools.
  </p>

<section id="cash">
  <h2>Cash</h2>
  <p>
    Cash in person is by far the easiest option if you'll see one of the pool administrators before the tournament starts.
    Note that because of lack of payment by some entries last year, <strong>you must pay an admin in person before tip
    off or your entry will be voided.</strong>
  </p>
</section>
<section id="bitcoin">
  <h2>Bitcoin</h2>
  <p>
    Bitcoin is an electronic currency that makes cash transactions easy and fee free on the internet. This is the only
    form of electronic payment accepted on Pool Madness.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process of funding a Bitcoin account is similar to PayPal.
  <ol>
    <li>Get a bitcoin wallet. We recommend <%= link_to "Coinbase", "http://coinbase.com" %></li>
    <li>Link your checking account to your Coinbase account</li>
    <li>Peform a standard checking account transfer to Coinbase (4 day hold)</li>
    <% if current_user.brackets.try(:size) == 1 %>
        <li><%= link_to "Pay for your bracket with Bitcoin", current_user.brackets.first %></li>
    <% else %>
        <li>Select "Pay with Bitcoin" on <%= link_to "your brackets", brackets_path %> page</li>
    <% end %>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Having a bitcoin account also makes it easy to collect any winnings from the pool. We can deposit money into your
    account within minutes of the tournament ending.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>If you need time for your transfer to coinbase to complete let one of the admins know and we'll mark you as paid.</strong>

<section id="popmoney">
  <h2>PopMoney</h2>
  <p>
    We have the ability to accept funds with <%= link_to "PopMoney", "http://popmoney.com" %>. Check to see if your bank
    is a member of the network. If so, send payment to <strong>jason@haruska.com</strong>. Be sure to email Jason and
    let him know to expect payment so he can mark you as paid.
  </p>
</section>
<section id="check">
  <h2>Check</h2>
  <p>
    If none of the options work for you, you can always mail a check. Again let Jason know you're doing this so he can
    mark you as paid. Please send the check to:
